# Sacramento State Repository
## About the Repository
This repository is home to all of my solutions to assignments for courses I have enrolled in. It contains both courses from institutions as well as online challenges and certificate courses. All coding materials and solutions were created and completed while I was enrolled at California State University - Sacramento.

## About the Student
My primary goal is to work on projects that contribute meaningfully to the community and address real-world problems. From my time at Sacramento State, I’ve gained a deep passion for Data Science and its potential to drive impactful solutions. Encouraged by my professor and advisor, I first added a minor in Statistics to my degree plan, which eventually led to me pursuing a full Statistics degree as a double major. While in college I had the opportunity to explore different fields such as Biomedical Engineering, Software Engineering, and Data Science and Analytics by engaging with different professors during office hours to explore these fields further. This interest depended after I enrolled in a Machine Learning class that is offered by the Computer Science department, as those fields go hand in hand. I’ve learned that the best way to enter the AI field is to start with Data Science and demonstrate experience in processing large datasets. My focus on Data Science is driven by the idea that access to the right tools and information can solve complex problems and create meaningful change. I believe that by dedicating my studies to developing the skills to analyze and interpret data, I’ll be able to support local businesses, improve the quality of healthcare, or develop innovations in biomedical and gene sciences. Ultimately, I see my education as a stepping stone to making a positive impact on the world around me.
